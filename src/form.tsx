                Example: Caterpie in vanilla ONLY has the Shield Dust ability, but in later gens it has Run Away as

                Away. BUT Butterfree will not have Tinted Lens since even though it has that as a Hidden Ability in

                is trigged, etc) that make it work as intended. For those who don't know, Pokemon Emerald's Psuedo
                Random Number Generator (PRNG) is broken. Because of this, people can manipulate their actions to
                produce a desired result, such as wating for the precise moment to throw a pokeball to catch a
                pokemon at full health, or getting a pokemon with perfect IVs.
            </p>
            <p>
                The casual player probably won't notice something like that, but a few people have requested this
                feature so I have added it as an option.
            </p>
            <p>
                Side note: The reason why it's called a PSUEDO Random Number Generator is because computers aren't
                able to do purely random things, so the way it is accomplished is by making an algorithm that
                outputs seemingly unrelated numbers based on a start point (called a SEED) determined when you open
                the game/turn on the device. This means that if you knew the exact algorithm and the seed, you would
                have access to all the "random" results, and cheat accordingly. The reason Emerald's PRNG is broken
                is because it does not "re-seed", every time you start the game, it uses the exact same seed so it
                is able to be predicted and therefore abused. Those who have played games like Minecraft where you
                can choose your own seed can relate to this; if you use the same seed, you get the same world and
                can plan an optimal route, where rare resources spawn and such.

            </p>
            <p>
                The main appeal of this is the additional coverage given to many Pokemon, for example, Psyduck does
                not get a single attacking water move until level 50 in Emerald. With the Gen4-lite Movesets,
                Psyduck gets Water Gun at level 9.
